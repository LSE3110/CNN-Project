Convolutional Neural Network Project

## Project title:

Classification of plants diseases

## Summary:
Project Description and Motivation: 

This project aims to classify diseased and healthy plant leaves. I am going to use convolutional neural networks to identify crop species and diseases. I want to explore different architectures to test and compare the different models. The dataset contains 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions.
